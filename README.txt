Hi!

Here's my submission for the customer feedback page challenge.

Instructions:

1. Create a postgresql db on default settings (port 5432). username should be "postgres", password should be "password". if not, update the credentials.js file (api) accordingly.
2. Name the database "customerfeedbackpage" 
3. In the api/sql folder, run the scripts (in pgadmin) to create and populate the database tables required
4. Run "npm install" in both the app and api directories to download all required packages.
5. Run the api (npm run dev) and it should print to console "API listening on port 8080"
6. Run the app (npm run start) and the app should open up in your preferred browser. Enjoy!
